## How to create an environment to test vulnerabilities

1. Make an account on PortSwigger 
2. Navigate to  https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs
3. Search for the desired vulnerability
4. Create a lab.
5. Retrieve the personally assigned LAB URL



## Web servers testing
1. metasploit

## Offensive WebAPP Pentesting. Module [TIDOS](https://github.com/teocns/TIDoS-Framework)

1. File Inclusions
2. OS Command Injection Linux & Windows (RCE)




## SQL Injection


SQLMap is a powerful kali-linux tool. 
We need to study the python library:
https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap

Example usage generated by OpenAI (requires test):
```
from sqlmap import sqlmap

urls = ['http://testurl1.com', 'http://testurl2.com']

for url in urls:
    params = {
        'url': url,
        'data': {
            'param1': 'value1',
            'param2': 'value2'
        }
    }
    sqlmap.test_vuln(params)
```
## Server side requets forgery

Payloads: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Request%20Forgery
Description: https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/
 


## Vulnerable and Outdated Components
This vulnerability refers to what is usually non-updated dependencies that were reported to be vulnerable.
We can use metasploit to run targets against CVE vulnerabilities.
