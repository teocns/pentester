## How to create an environment to test vulnerabilities

1. Make an account on PortSwigger 
2. Navigate to  https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs
3. Search for the desired vulnerability
4. Create a lab.
5. Retrieve the personally assigned LAB URL





1. XSS https://github.com/epsylon/xsser


## SQL Injection


SQLMap is a powerful kali-linux tool. 
We need to study the python library:
https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap

Example usage generated by OpenAI (requires test):
```
from sqlmap import sqlmap

urls = ['http://testurl1.com', 'http://testurl2.com']

for url in urls:
    params = {
        'url': url,
        'data': {
            'param1': 'value1',
            'param2': 'value2'
        }
    }
    sqlmap.test_vuln(params)
```
## Server side requets forgery

## Vulnerable and Outdated Components
This vulnerability refers to what is usually non-updated dependencies that were reported to be vulnerable.
We can use metasploit to run targets against CVE vulnerabilities.

Metasploit framework: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework
Python lib: https://github.com/allfro/pymetasploit


PyMetasploit is a full-fledged msfrpc library for Python. It is meant to interact with the msfrpcd daemon that comes with the latest versions of Metasploit. It does NOT interact with the console-based scripts that Metasploit provides such as msfconsole, msfvenom, etc. Therefore, before you can begin to use this library, you'll need to initialize msfrpcd and optionally (highly recommended) PostgreSQL.
